Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) is a library that allows you to seamlessly build cross-platform Bitcoin wallets without worrying about bitcoin internals.

BDK is based on the powerful [`rust-bitcoin`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin) and [`rust-miniscript`](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-miniscript) libraries.

Learn the simplest way to integrate Bitcoin wallet features into any application at [bitcoindevkit.org](https://bitcoindevkit.org/).
